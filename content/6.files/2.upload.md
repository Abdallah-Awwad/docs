# Upload Files

Multiple files can be uploaded simultaneously via both the Data Studio and programmatically via the API. File uploads are not limited to just images, they can be any kind of file.

## Data Studio

<!-- TODO: Screenshot of the files module -->

Open the files module on the left. This will show your File Library. This acts as one big Folder to store all uploaded files. You can create sub-folders to keep these organized.

Create a folder called `Images` and click on +.

You'll see a popup with options for uploading your file:

- Dragging a file from your desktop.
- Clicking on the popup area to select a file from your machine.
- Clicking on the menu in the popup and selecting "**Import from URL**"

Optionally, you can also click the File Display to open the File Details Page and fill in information as desired.

## API 

::snippets
#rest
```http [POST /files]

Body must be formatted as a `multipart/form-data` with a final property called `file`.
```

#graphql

Not supported by GraphQL

#sdk
```js
import { createDirectus, rest, uploadFiles } from '@directus/sdk';

const client = createDirectus('https://directus.example.com').with(rest());

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file_1_property', 'Value');
formData.append('file', raw_file);
formData.append('file_2_property', 'Value');
formData.append('file', raw_file_2);

const result = await client.request(uploadFiles(formData));
```

::

The file contents has to be provided in a property called `file`. All other properties of
the file object can be provided as well, except `filename_disk` and `filename_download`.
