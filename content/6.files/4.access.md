# Access Files

Folders and File information are stored in regular Collections, which means [User and Role access permissions](/auth/access-control) are fully configurable and granular on both Folders and Files.

## Downloading a File

To download an asset with the correct filename, you need to add the `?download` query parameter to the request and the
`download` attribute to your anchor tag. This will ensure the appropriate
[Content-Disposition](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec19.html) headers are added. Without this, the
download will work on the _same_ domain, however it will have the file's "id" as the filename for cross-origin requests.

Fetching transformed assets is done by adding a `key` query parameter to the original file's URL. In the Data Studio, you can
configure different asset presets that control the output of any given image. If a requested transformed asset doesn't yet
exist, it is dynamically generated and immediately returned.
