# Manage Files

When a file is clicked in the File Listing Page, the File Details Page appears. This is a custom form for viewing assets
and embeds, with core Fields included out-of-the-box (see below), and the ability for Administrators to add additional
custom Fields. This page has the same features and functionality as the
Item Page.

<!-- TODO: ![Files](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/app-guide/file-library/file-library-20220305A/files-20220305A.webp) -->

## Action Buttons

Notice the following Buttons in the Header:

TODO: Bring over Data Studio

- <span mi btn >check</span> – Saves any edits made to the file.
- <span mi btn sec>tune</span> – Please see [Edit an Image](#edit-an-image) to learn more.
- <span mi btn sec>save_alt</span> – Downloads the file to your current device.
- <span mi btn sec>drive_file_move</span> – Moves selected File(s) to another Folder.
- <span mi btn dngr>delete</span> – Permanently removes the File and its metadata. This action is permanent and cannot
  be undone.

::callout{type="info" title="Deleting Files Linked to Items"}

By default, Directus will not allow you to delete a File until you remove it from any and all related Items. However,
this behavior can be reconfigured so that Files automatically update when the image is deleted by setting the relational
constraint of your File Field to `SET NULL` or `CASCADE` when the File is deleted.

## File Details

The Files Collection comes pre-configured with the following Fields out of the box. New Fields can be created and
customized as needed in **Settings > Data Model**. However the pre-configured Fields cannot be changed or deleted.

![File Details](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/app-guide/file-library/file-library-20220305A/file-details-20220305A.webp)
