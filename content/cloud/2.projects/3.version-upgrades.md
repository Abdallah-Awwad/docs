# Version Upgrades

Cloud projects are automatically updated in rolling releases (i.e. done with no downtime). These updates keep your project on the latest version and fully up to date with all cloud exclusives, dependencies and
security patches.

You'll get notified in the Cloud dashboard when an update takes place. If there are significant breaking changes, we will notify you with enough time to migrate any of your logic before the upgrade.
