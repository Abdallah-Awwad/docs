# Auth Quickstart

This guide will cover registering users, logging in, and making an authenticated request.

:partial{content="quickstart-making-calls"}

## Before You Start

You will need a Directus project.

:directus-cloud

Create a `posts` collection with at least a `title` and `content` field. Follow the [data modeling quickstart](/data-modeling/quickstart) to learn more. Create a single item in the collection.

## Creating a Role and a Policy

From your settings, navigate to User Roles and create a new role named "User". This role will later be applied to new users who register.

Within the role page, create a new policy named "Read Posts". Add a permission to the policy to allow **Read** action on `posts` collection.

## Allow User Registration

From your settings, enable User Registration. Select the User role that was just created and disable the Verify Email setting.

## Registering via the Data Studio

Log out of the Data Studio. From the Sign In screen, you will see a new option to Sign Up. Once a user is signed up, they will immediately be able to log in.

## Registering via API

Open your terminal and run the following command to register a new user.

```bash [Terminal]
curl \
--request POST \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ "email": "hello@example.com", "password": "d1r3ctu5" }' \
--url 'https://directus.example.com/register'
```

Go to the user directory by clicking :icon{name="user-directory"} in the module bar and you should see a new user has been created.

## Logging In

To log in and get an access token, run the following command.

```bash [Terminal]
curl \
--request POST \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{ "email": "hello@example.com", "password": "d1r3ctu5" }' \
--url 'https://directus.example.com/auth/login'
```

## Authenticating Requests

You can use the access token while making requests. If your token has expired, you must refresh it.

```bash [Terminal]
curl \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
--url 'https://directus.example.com/items/posts'
```
