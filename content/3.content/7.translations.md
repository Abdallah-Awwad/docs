# Translations

Localising content in Directus involves using translation strings, which are multilingual key-value pairs that you can use throughout the app. They enable you to translate things like dropdown options, placeholder text, field notes, and more.

To create a translation string, navigate to Settings > Translation Strings and click on :icon{name="material-symbols:add-circle-rounded"} in the page header and a drawer will open.

Add a key and click on "Create New" to open another drawer. Select the language and type in the corresponding translation. Click on :icon{name="material-symbols:check-circle"} to confirm and add the translation.

Throughout the settings module, you will notice certain input fields have a :icon{name="material-symbols:translate"} icon on them, meaning you have the option assign a translation string.

To assign a translation string, navigate to the input that you'd like to add a translation string to. There are two ways to assign a translation string:

- Click :icon{name="material-symbols:translate"} and a dropdown menu with all translation strings will appear.
- Type `$t:translation-string-key` and hit enter.

Choose a translation string key as desired.

::callout{type="info" title="Switching Language"}

There are two ways to change the app language. Administrators can set the project's
[default language](/configuration/translations), while users can choose their own personal
language preference.

You can also click ":icon{name="material-symbols:add-circle-rounded"} New Translation String" in the :icon{name="material-symbols:translate"} dropdown menu to create a new translation string on the fly.
