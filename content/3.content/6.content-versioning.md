# Content Versioning

Content versioning allows teams to create and manage different versions of their content. There are several reasons to
use content versioning, including drafting content without publishing it, and more ways to collaborate effectively.

## Concepts

- **Version**: a version is a snapshot of the differences between the original item and the created version. Each
- version represents a set of future changes to be applied to the item.
- **Main**: the main version is the original version of a piece of content that has been created and published. It is
- the default version that is displayed to users. The main version is the "source of truth" for all other versions.
- **Promote**: promoting a version means to make it the new main version. When a new version is promoted, it becomes
   the main version that is displayed to users, and it replaces the previous main version.

## Setting Up Content Versioning

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Navigate to **Settings** > **Data Model**, select the collection that you want to enable content versioning for, and scroll down to the content versioning section. Toggle "Enable Versions" and save your data model.

## Creating a New Version

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Open an item within your versioned collection. At the top of the item view, you will notice a dropdown with the main Content Version displayed as "main". Select "Create Version" and provide a key and a name for the new version. You can then save your new version.

All new versions originate from the main version. This implies that the main version acts as the single source of truth
for other versions.

## Making Changes to a Version

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Open the item in the newly created version, and make the desired edits to the item's content.

Upon saving the changes, you'll notice that the main version remains unaffected, while the changes are reflected only in the modified version.

## Reviewing and Promoting a Version

Promoting a version will turn it into the main version.

Open the version you want to promote and select the "Promote Version" option from the dropdown. In the "Changes" tab, you can review all the changes made in the version and decide which changes to accept or reject. Switch to the "Preview" tab to see a preview of the changes you are about to promote. 

After promoting a version, you can choose to keep or delete the version.

You have the option to integrate Content Versioning through the API. To learn how to accomplish this, please refer to
our [API reference documentation](/api-reference/system/versions).

## Revisions and Content Versioning

Under the hood, content versions are stored in the `directus_revisions` collection. In bigger projects this collection
can get large.

Some Directus users combat this by periodically purging some or all data in this collection. Be aware that this could
unintentionally purge content versions.
