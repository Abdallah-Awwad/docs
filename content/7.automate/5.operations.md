# Operations

Operations are the individual actions in a flow. They enable you to do things like manage data within Directus,
transform the flow's data, send information off to outside services, set conditional logic, trigger other flows, and
more.

## Condition

<!-- TODO: ![Condition](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/configuration/flows/operations/operations-20220603A/condition-20220603A.webp) -->

A Condition operation lets you choose a success path or failure path by validating data passed into it with
[Filter Rules](/api-reference/filter-rules).

### Options

- **Condition Rules** — Create conditions with [Filter Rules](/api-reference/filter-rules).

### Payload

This operation does not generate data. If the filter rule is configured properly, it will append a `null` value on its
`operationKey`, regardless of if the condition was met or not. However, if the filter rule is misconfigured, it will
append an array containing an object you can use to help debug the misconfiguration.

::callout{type="warning"}

When using an [Event Hook](/automate/triggers) configured to be "Filter (Blocking)", if your flow ends
with a condition that executes with a `reject` path, it will cancel your database transaction.

## Run Script

<!--
<video autoplay playsinline muted loop controls title="Run Script">
	<source src="" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
-->

This operation lets you add a custom script using vanilla JavaScript or TypeScript. The script will be executed securely
in an isolated sandbox. No interactions take place between the sandbox and the host except for sharing input and output
values. This means, for example, no access to the file system and no ability to do network requests.

### Options

The operation provides a default function template. The optional `data` parameter lets you pass in the data chain as
an argument.

### Payload

The function's `return` value will be appended under its `<operationKey>`.

### More Details

As an example, let's say you have this function in a script operation, named `myScript`.

```json
// A key from the data chain
{
	"previousOperation": {
		"value": 5
	}
}
```

Then you add the following logic via Run Script.

```typescript
// Your function in the myScript operation
module.exports = function (data) {
	return {
		timesTwo: data.previousOperation.value * 2,
	};
};
```

The returned value will be appended under the `myScript` operation key.

```json
{
	"previousOperation": {
		"value": 5
	},
	"myScript": {
		"timesTwo": 10
	}
}
```

::callout{type="info"}

Make sure your `return` value is valid JSON.

::

::callout{type="info" title="Throwing Errors"}

If you throw an error in a Run Script operation, it will immediately break your flow chain and stop execution of
subsequent flows. If you used a ["Blocking" Event hook](/automate/triggers), throwing an error will cancel
the original event transaction to the database.

::

::callout{type="info" title="Node Modules"}

To prevent unauthorized access to the underlying server, node modules can't be used in the Run Script operation. If
you require a third party library for your custom script, you can create a custom
[operation extension](/extensions/api-extensions/operations) instead.

Studio. This is a key tool for troubleshooting flow configuration. A Log operation's key will have a null value on the
data chain.

### Options

- **Message** — Sets a [log message](/automate/quickstart).

### Payload

This operation does not generate data for the data chain as its messages are for debugging and troubleshooting. It will
append a `null` value on the `operationKey`.

## Send Email

This operation sends off emails.

### Options

- **To** — Sets the email addresses. Hit enter to save the email. Click on a pill to remove
  it.
- **Subject** — Set the subject line.
- **Body** — Use a Markdown or WYSIWYG editor to create the email body.

### Payload

This operation does not generate data for the data chain. It will append a `null` value on the `operationKey`.

### More Details

::callout{type="info" title="Batch Emails"}

You can input an array of emails in the `To` input option to send off multiple emails.

::

::callout{type="info"}

If you are testing out this operation from `localhost:8080`, be sure to check your spam box, because your email provider
may send it there automatically.

  it.
- **Permissions** — Define the role that this operation will inherit permissions from.
- **Title** — Set the title of the notification.

### Options

- **Milliseconds** — Define the number of milliseconds to sleep.

### Payload

This operation does not generate data. It will append a `null` value on its `operationKey`.

## Transform Payload

<!-- TODO: ![Transform Payload](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/configuration/flows/operations/operations-20220603A/transform-payload-20220603A.webp) -->

multiple sources of data and consolidate them into a single payload.

### Options

- **JSON** — Define JSON to insert into the data chain.

### Payload

When an operation completes successfully, the value you defined under the JSON configuration operation is appended
onto its `operationKey`.

`operationKey`. If no response body is configured, `null` is appended under this `operationKey`.

### More Details
