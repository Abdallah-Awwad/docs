# Flows

Flows enable custom, event-driven data processing and task automation within Directus. Each flow is composed of one trigger, a series of operations, and a data chain that is passed between each step.

## Fields

- **Name (required)** — The displayed name of the Flow.
- **Status** — Sets the flow to active or inactive.
- **Icon** — Adds an icon to help quickly identify the flow.
- **Description** — Sets a brief verbal description of the flow.
- **Color** — Sets a color to help identify the flow.
- **Activity and Logs Tracking** — Lets you **Track Activity and Logs**, **Activity**, or **Neither**.

## Logs

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Accessible from the sidebar, logs store information for each flow execution. Each log will display information from
triggers as well as each operation in the flow. To access a flow's logs, follow these steps.

Logs are not a 1:1 mapping to the data chain. Each trigger and operation gets its own dropdown, which stores its
relevant data. Here's what you'll get from each of these:

### Trigger

- **Options** — The values you input when you configured the trigger.
- **Payload** — Displays the data appended under `$trigger`.
- **Accountability** — Displays data appended under `$accountability`.

Note that `$accountability` is not nested under the `$trigger` key. However, it is listed under the Trigger in the Log
because `$accountability` is generated by the trigger.

### `<OperationKey>`

- **Options** — The values you input when you configured the operation.\
  _(These configuration options are not stored on the data chain)_.
- **Payload** — Displays the data appended under this `<operationKey>`.

::callout{type="warning" title="Logs are stored in the database"}

Keep in mind that if you've configured a flow to track logs, all this information is stored in the database. You may
need to periodically delete this data.

::

::callout{type="info" title="Where is `$last`?"}

You may notice `$last` is not in the Logs. Remember, `$last` constantly updates to store the data of the most recently
executed operation. The log shows the results of the entire flow. Therefore `$last` would simply be the very last
operation in the flow.
