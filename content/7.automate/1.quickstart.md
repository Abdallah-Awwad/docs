# Automate Quickstart

## Before You Start

You will need a Directus project.

:directus-cloud

Flows enable custom, event-driven data processing and task automation within Directus. Each flow is composed of one trigger, a series of operations and a data chain.

## Create a Flow

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Navigate to the [Flows](/automate/flows) section in the Settings module. Click on :icon{name="material-symbols:add-circle"} in the page header, which will cause a drawer to open. Fill in a name, and the rest is optional.

## Configure a Trigger

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Click on :icon{name="material-symbols:play-arrow"} to open trigger setup. Select a [trigger type](/automate/triggers)
and configure it as required.

## Configure an Operation

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Click on :icon{name="material-symbols:add-circle"} on the trigger panel.

Here, you can create an [operation](/automate/operations). Give it a name and key, and select a type.

### Control Flow

Flows let you implement
[control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow), by providing success paths and failure paths within
a flow:

- **Success** — If `operation1` executes successfully, then `operation2` executes.
- **Failure** — Else if `operation1` fails on execution, then `operation3` executes.
