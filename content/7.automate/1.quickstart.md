# Automate Quickstart

This guide will cover custom event-driven data processing using Directus Automate.

## Before You Start

You will need a Directus project.

:directus-cloud

Create a `posts` collection with at least a `title` and `content` field. [Follow the Data Modeling quickstart to learn more](/data-modeling/quickstart).

## Create a Flow

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Navigate to the [Flows](/automate/flows) section in the Settings module. Click on :icon{name="material-symbols:add-circle"} in the page header, which will cause a drawer to open. Fill in the name "Post Created".

## Configure a Trigger

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Click on :icon{name="material-symbols:play-arrow"} to open trigger setup. Select "Event Hook" as the [trigger type](/automate/triggers)
and select "Filter (Blocking)".

Select `items.create` as the scope, and then check the "Posts" collection. Finally, select "Data of Last Operation".

## Configure an Operation

<!-- TODO: Image -->

Click on :icon{name="material-symbols:add-circle"} on the trigger panel.

Here, you can create an [operation](/automate/operations). Give it the name "Notify Post Created" and the key "notify_post_created" will be written alongside.

Select the "Send Email" operation type. Fill in the "To", "Subject" and "Body" fields accordingly.

When finished, click on :icon{name="material-symbols:check-circle-rounded"} in the flow's top right corner.

Now, when you create a post, the email address you entered will be notified.
