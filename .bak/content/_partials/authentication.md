While the Public role can be configured to make data available without authentication, anything that is not public requires a user to authenticate their requests.

Each user can have a single Static Tokens that does not expire (though can be regenerated). Standard and Session Tokens are returned after a user logs in, are short lived, and need refreshing.

Requests can be authenticated in the following ways:

::tabs
	::tab{label="Authorization Header"}
	Add the following header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
	::

	::tab{label="Session Cookies"}
	You do not need to set anything. The `directus_session_token` is used automatically.
	::

	::tab{label="Query Parameter"}
	Append the following query parameter: `?access_token=<token>`.

		::callout{type="info" title="Exercise caution when using query parameters for authentication"}
		Using a query parameter for authentication can lead to it being revealed or logged. If possible, use another method.
