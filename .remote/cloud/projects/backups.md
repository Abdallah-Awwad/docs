# Backups

By default, file assets and databases are backed up once per day on all projects. Enterprise customers can work with our team for more tailored backup solutions. 

In the event of an emergency, such as your project crashing, don't worry! Your data will be safe. If you need access to your backed-up data, [contact us](https://directus.io/contact).
