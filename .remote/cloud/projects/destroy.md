# Destroy a Project

Destroying a Directus Cloud project completely removes all its data, assets, settings and users from the platform. It also cancels the Directus Cloud subscription associated with the project. 

<!-- TODO: Image -->

To destroy a Directus Cloud project, open the project you wish to delete. Click on "Edit" to enter the project details page, and scroll to the bottom of the page and toggle :icon{name="material-symbols:local-fire-department-rounded" title="Fire Button"}. Type in the project name and confirm.


::callout{type="info"}

This action will break any external apps connecting to the project's API or linking to project files, and is permanent and irreversible. **Directus is not responsible for data or files lost due to this action!**
