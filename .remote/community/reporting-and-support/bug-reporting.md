# Bug Reporting

If you're experiencing issues or think you have found a problem in Directus, be sure to follow the troubleshooting steps before reporting a bug. You can also [view the system status of Directus’ various cloud systems and incident history](https://status.directus.cloud/).

If you happen to run into a bug, please post an issue on [our main GitHub issue board](https://github.com/directus/directus/issues).

Please be as detailed as you can in the bug report, we ask within the template to include details on how to reproduce your issue as well as which version, hosting strategy, and database you are using. The more information available, the easier it is for other contributors to help you find a solution. For example, it might be worth adding a schema snapshot file or a database dump.
